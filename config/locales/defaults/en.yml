    upviews:
      title: 'Unique pageviews'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of visits during which the page was viewed at least once'
      context: 'This page makes up %{percent_org_views}% of all views.'
      unit: ''
      total: ''
      data_source: google_analytics
      about: >
        This represents the number of visits in which the page was viewed at least once. 
        For example, if a user visits the same page 5 times during their browsing session,
        it will show up as 1 unique pageview.
    pviews:
      title: 'Pageviews'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of times the page was viewed'
      context: ''
      unit: ''
      total: ''
      data_source: google_analytics
      about: >
        This is a count of every time the page was viewed. For example, if someone visits page X,
        then goes to page Y and then page X again, the page X will show having 2 pageviews (and
        1 unique pageview).
    pageviews_per_visit:
      title: 'Pageviews per visit'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of times per visit the page was viewed'
      context: ''
      unit: ''
      total: ''
      data_source: calculated_google_analytics
      about: >
        This figure is calculated by dividing Google Analytic pageviews by unique pageviews. It 
        shows on average how many times a page was viewed during users' session. If a page has a 
        high ratio (above 1.4), this indicates that users have to come back to that page within 
        their session - investigate the navigation from that page further to identify any issues.
    searches:
      title: 'Searches from the page'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of on-page searches'
      context: '%{percent_users_searched}% of users searched from the page'
      unit: 'search terms'
      total: ''
      data_source: none
      about: >
        This is the number of internal site search that were started from the page. When people
        use internal search, it's an indication that they haven't found what they're looking for.
    satisfaction:
      title: 'User satisfaction score'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Percentage of users who answered ''yes'' to the ''Is this page useful?'' survey'
      context: 'Users who found this page useful, out of %{total_responses} responses'
      unit: ''
      total: '%{total_responses} responses'
      data_source: none
      about: >
        Percentage of users who answered 'Yes' rather than 'No' to the 'Is this page useful?' survey.
        The more users who responded, the more reliable the score is. For a more reliable score
        on a page that doens't have many responses, choose a longer time period. This survey was
        introduced in February 2018 so there are no responses before this date.
    feedex:
      title: 'Number of feedback comments'
      short_title: 'Feedback comments'
      summary: 'Number of anonymous user responses to ''Is there anything wrong with this page?'''
      context: ''
      unit: 'comments'
      total: ''
      data_source: feedback_explorer
      about: >
        You can use Feedback Explorer ('Feedex') to find out what users are saying about your
        content. A high rate of feedback could indicate a problem with the content. The data comes
        from the 'Is there anything wrong with this page?' form and the satisfaction survey at the 
        end of a transaction that started on GOV.UK.

        You'll need a Signon account with Feedback Explorer permissions to see the comments.
    words:
      title: 'Word count'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of words on the page'
      context: ''
      unit: ''
      total: ''
      data_source: none
      about: >
        Lots of words on a page can make content difficult for users to read online. The longer the
        page is, the less usable it is likely to be. You could investigate whether this content could
        be shorter. Otherwise, does it have headings and bulletpoint to help users scan?
    pdf_count:
      title: 'Number of PDFs'
      short_title: ''
      summary: 'Number of .pdf attachements on the page'
      context: ''
      unit: ''
      total: ''
      data_source: none
      about: >
        Compared with HTML content, information published in a PDF is harder to find, use and 
        maintain. PDFs can often be bad for accessibility and rarely comply with open standards.
        Serveral PDFs on one page may indicate that too many users needs are being met by them.
        Read more about why to avoid PDFs.
