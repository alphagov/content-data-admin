        This represents the number of visits in which the page was viewed at least once.
        For example, if a user visits the same page 5 times during their browsing session,
        it will show up as 1 unique pageview.

      about_title: 'About page views'
      about: >
        This is a count of every time the page was viewed. For example, if someone visits page X,
        then goes to page Y and then back to page X again, page X will have 2 page views (and
        1 unique page view).

      about: >
        This figure is calculated by dividing Google Analytics page views by unique page views. It
        shows on average how many times a page was viewed during a user's session. If a page has a
        high ratio (above 1.4), this indicates that users have to come back to that page within
        their session - investigate the navigation from that page further to identify any issues.

      external_link: 'See search terms in Google Analytics (opens in new tab)'
      about_title: 'About searches from page'
      about: >
        This is the number of internal site searches that were started from the page. When people
        use internal search, it could be an indication that they haven't found what they're looking for. You'll need access to Google Analytics to see the search terms.

      about: >
        Percentage of users who answered 'Yes' rather than 'No' to the 'Is this page useful?' survey found on every page of GOV.UK.
        The more users who responded, the more reliable the score is. For a more reliable score
        on a page that doesn't have many responses, choose a longer time period. This survey was
        introduced in February 2018 so there are no responses before this date.

        You can use Feedback Explorer ('Feedex') to find out what users are saying about your
        content. A high rate of feedback could indicate a problem with the content. The data comes
        from the 'Is there anything wrong with this page?' form and the satisfaction survey at the
        end of a transaction that started on GOV.UK.

        You'll need a Signon account with Feedback Explorer permissions to see the comments.

      about: >
        Lots of words on a page can make content difficult for users to read online. The longer the
        page is, the less usable it is likely to be. You could investigate whether this content could
        be shorter. Otherwise, does it have headings and bulletpoints to help users scan?

        Reading time is calculated by dividing the word count for the page by an average reading speed
        of 200 words per minute. The time it takes to read the page is rounded up to the nearest minute.
        This calculation doesn’t take into account how complicated the content is or any of the page’s
        attachments.

      about_title: 'About number of PDFs'
      about: >
        Compared with HTML content, information published in a PDF is harder to find, use and
        maintain. PDFs can often be bad for accessibility and rarely comply with open standards.
        Several PDFs on one page may indicate that too many user needs are being met by them.
